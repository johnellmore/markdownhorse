**_Write markdown files, serve them as HTML._**

![CI status badge](https://github.com/johnellmore/markdownhorse/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

Add this line to the beginning of any Markdown document:

```html
{LATEST_TAG}
```

and change the extension to `.html` or `.md.html`. When you open the file in a browser, you'll see nicely-rendered Markdown--no extra work required.
